# User Stories: Motor Control (DRV8833) Integration

## Story 1: Initialize DRV8833 motor drivers
**As a** developer **I want** to initialize both DRV8833 channels so that motors are ready for control.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Driver instances created without errors.
- Each motor channel can be toggled (forward/coast) in a bench test.

## Story 2: Set motor speed and direction with unified API
**As a** developer **I want** to set motor speed using a normalized value (-1.0 to 1.0) so that I can abstract hardware details from control logic.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `set_motor(id, speed)` maps correctly to forward/reverse & PWM duty.
- Speeds beyond range are clamped with a warning/log.

## Story 3: Implement braking and coasting modes
**As a** developer **I want** to choose between brake and coast when stopping so that I can adapt to different flight/control scenarios.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Configuration flag selects brake or coast behavior.
- Stopping applies correct DRV8833 pin state.

## Story 4: Add optional ramping / acceleration limiting
**As a** developer **I want** to limit how fast motor speed changes so that I can reduce mechanical and electrical stress.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Ramping can be enabled/disabled.
- Large speed deltas are spread across multiple update cycles.

## Story 5: Failsafe on gamepad disconnect or critical sensor fault
**As a** developer **I want** motors to immediately stop on control/sensor failure so that the system is safe.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Gamepad disconnect triggers motor stop within one loop iteration.
- Sensor fault flag triggers motor stop.
- Logged event includes timestamp and fault type.

## Story 6: Provide motor status telemetry
**As a** developer **I want** to query current commanded speeds and fault states so that I can log and debug motor behavior.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `get_status()` returns structured dict per motor: speed, last_update, fault.
- Telemetry accessible by flight computer.

## Story 7: Integration test: gamepad throttle to motors
**As a** developer **I want** gamepad input mapped to motor outputs so that manual control is verified.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Simulated throttle input produces proportional motor PWM.
- Reverse command maps to negative speed values.

## Story 8: Emergency stop command
**As a** developer **I want** a software emergency stop so that I can immediately neutralize all motors.
**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Calling `emergency_stop()` halts all motors regardless of prior state.
- Further `set_motor` calls ignored until system reset or `clear_fault()`.
