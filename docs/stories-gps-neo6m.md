# User Stories: GPS (NEO-6M Compatible) Integration

## Story 1: As a developer, I want to connect the NEO-6M GPS module to the Pico via UART so that I can receive GPS data

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - The Pico can detect and communicate with the GPS module over UART.
  - Communication errors are logged and handled.

## Story 2: As a developer, I want to parse latitude, longitude, altitude, speed, and time from the GPS data so that I can use it for navigation

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - GPS data is parsed and output for debugging.
  - Data is available at a regular interval (e.g., 1Hz).

## Story 3: As a developer, I want to make GPS location data available to the flight control system so that the drone can use it for navigation and telemetry

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Location data is accessible by other modules.
  - Data is updated in real time.

## Story 4: As a developer, I want to handle GPS errors gracefully so that the flight computer remains robust

- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - GPS read failures do not crash the system.
  - Errors are logged and retried.
