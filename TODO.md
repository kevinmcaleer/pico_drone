# TODO: Outstanding Tasks for Pico Drone Project

## Safety & Flight Readiness
- [ ] Add integration tests for main flight loop (simulate all sensors, motors, and control logic)
- [ ] Add tests for motor control and failsafe/stop logic (e.g., on sensor/gamepad failure)
- [ ] Add tests for Bluetooth gamepad input and disconnection scenarios
- [ ] Add hardware-in-the-loop or simulation tests for real-world validation

## Code & Features
- [ ] Integrate `drv8833.py` motor driver into `flight_computer.py`
- [ ] Final review and improvement of error handling for IMU and Magnetometer modules
- [ ] Add documentation/examples for motor driver usage in main flight computer
- [ ] Close Epic and remaining issues when all features are complete

## Documentation
- [ ] Update user and developer documentation for new motor driver and safety features
- [ ] Add a section on test coverage and safety validation in the README
